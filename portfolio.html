            My name is Stephanie Zapuchlak and I am a <b>Web Developer and Designer</b>.
            I have a passion for making beautiful, cohesive sites with intuitive
            interfaces. Not only do I enjoy the design process, but coding has
            become one of my favorite pastimes. I am based out of <b>Minneapolis, Minnesota</b>
            , but like a true <b>Wisconsinite</b>  I live every day with compassion and a warm soul ( <b>despite
            the icy cold weather *le sigh* </b>). No matter the distance or where I end up, my heart still lies
            in the Wisconsin traditions of <b> bubbly beer</b>,<b> great cheese</b>, <b>and interesting conversation.</b>

        <h1 class ="infoAboutMe">
    From a young age, I have always loved the elements of design. For Christmas, I'd ask my parents for label makers,
    gel pens, and font books. I would sit for hours looking at pretty fonts and designing works of art (more like
    kid scribbles) in KidPix and PrintShop. Fast forward 20 years, I started working as a hairstylist, where I could
    use that creative freedom to create lovely works of hair art. But something was still missing. In my spare time in
    between clients, I'd hop on the computer to touch up client before/after photos and work on the company blog.
    The more I sat behind the computer and designed, the more I felt at home.  I kept ignoring that
    little whisper in the back of my head to do something in the tech world, until I uprooted to Minneapolis and
    started fresh. I went back to school in 2015 for my A.A.S in software development and am in the midst of a Bachelors of Science
    for Internet and Web Development. Every single day I wake up to experience more of what I love and couldn't be
    more excited to grow professionally and creatively.

                        I believe that a well developed and designed web site speaks for itself. While other websites may
                        be cluttered and packed full of content, a web site with structure , goals, and the right design for
                        the target demographic doesn't have to be jam packed or over saturated. My mission is to develop
                        visually appealing websites while being goal driven.

                        confidence in myself and being realistic about what I can achieve. By pushing myself to the limit, I can
                        achieve goals I may not have thought I was capable of.</p2>

                    <p2 class="explanation">When you are creating a website it is of great importance that it runs smoothly,
                        targeted to a demographic, and developed in accordance with specific criteria. You may forget coding is often overlooked,
                        but is what makes the page run effortlessly. Coding is the weightroom of the website. I plan on hitting those weights everyday.</p2>
